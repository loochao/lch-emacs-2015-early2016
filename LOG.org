*** tabbar-ruler and textmate-yas => inbox
[2014-04-17 Thu]
tabbar-ruler provide useful keystroke and functionality for the tabbar
manipulation. Color is a little awkward, needs tweak.

textmate-yas.el translates snippets in textmate into Yasnippets, but there's
bugs which cause it not evaluatable.
*** Add a folder named inbox
To keep good plugins which just need a little tweak.
*** Enable <Tab> for YASnippet

- Start to use YASnippet more and more, so enable tab for the expansion.
- Amazingly, it does not conflict with org, so in org, tab works as
hide/expand. Then use M-' to yas-expand.
